# K-means
Cluster algorithm to plot how k-means works.

100 data points and 2 means are randomly generated.

The algorithm has two steps:
1) Data are classified according to the initial means.
2) Means are re-estimated given the data that was classified in step 1.
Steps 1 and 2 are repeated until means do not change.

For every iteration, a plot is generated to visualy follow the clusters.
