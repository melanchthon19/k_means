# K-means
Run ./k_means.py to plot how k-means works.

100 data points and 2 means are randomly generated.

The algorithm has two steps:
1) Data are classified according to the initial means.
2) Means are re-estimated given the data that was classified in step 1.
Steps 1 and 2 are repeated until means do not change.

For every iteration, a plot is generated to visualy follow the clusters.

# Usage
Clone repository and run k_means.py using any IDE.
